How VCFloat became LGPL licensed instead of GPL licensed: a History

VCFloat, a Coq Framework for verifying floating-point computations,
was originally developed by researchers at Reservoir Labs Inc.
It was copyright (c) 2015 Reservoir Labs Inc., made open-source
under the Gnu Public License (GPL), and published in a github repo.

In 2021 and 2022, Andrew Appel and Ariel Kellison made contributions
to the github repo, which were also (therefore) GPL Licensed.

In 2022, Reservoir Labs Inc. was acquired by Qualcomm.  Qualcomm determined
that this was not an open-source project that they wanted to continue
to maintain.  Since Andrew Appel was interested in maintaining and improving
VCFloat, Qualcomm generously decided to transfer all its copyright ownership
in VCFloat to Andrew Appel, which was done by contract in June 2022.

The maintainers of a GPL-licensed repository cannot simply change the license
to some other license, even LGPL, unless every one of the copyright owners agrees.
In July 2022, "every one of the copyright owners" was Andrew Appel and Ariel Kellison.
On 10 July 2022, those owners hereby license their copyrighted software under the LGPL.

We welcome contributions by others to VCFloat, which will continue to be LGPL licensed.

Below, for historical purposes, we reproduce the license agreement as it stood
in June 2022.
