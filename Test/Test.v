(** NANS:  Each different computer architecture supports the same IEEE-754
  floating-point standard, but with slightly different Not-a-number (NAN) behavior.
  That behavior is encapsulated in a Nans typeclass.  You can instantiate that
  appropriate for your own architecture; but all the demos in this file are
  independent of the Nans details, so we can leave it abstract, like this: *)

(** We will demonstrate VCfloat on a symplectic ODE (ordinary differential 
  equation) integration for a simple harmonic oscillator. *)

Definition h := (1 / 32)%F32.   (* Time-step: 1/32 of a second *)

(* Force, as a function of position *)
Definition F (x : ftype Tsingle ) : ftype Tsingle := (-x)%F32.

(** Compute one time-step: given "ic" which is a pair of position and velocity,
  calculate the new position and velocity after time "h" has elapsed. *)
Definition leapfrog_step ( ic : ftype Tsingle * ftype Tsingle) : ftype Tsingle * ftype Tsingle :=
  let x  := fst ic in let v:= snd ic in 
  let x' := ((x + h * v) + ((1/2) * (h * h)) * F x)%F32 in
  let v' :=  (v +  (1/2 * h) * (F x + F x'))%F32 in 
  (x', v').

(** Calculate a new position, as a function of position x and velocity v *)
Definition leapfrog_stepx x v := fst (leapfrog_step (x,v)).

(** Calculate a new velocity, as a function of position x and velocity v *)
Definition leapfrog_stepv x v := snd (leapfrog_step (x,v)).

(** In deep-embedded (syntactic) expressons, variables are represented
  by "ident"ifiers, which are actually small positive numbers. *)
Definition _x : ident := 1%positive.  (* Variable name for position *)
Definition _v : ident := 2%positive.  (* Variable name for velocity *)

(** These two lines compute a deep-embedded "expr"ession from
  a shallow-embedded Coq expression.  *)

Definition v' := ltac:(let e' := 
  HO_reify_float_expr constr:([_x; _v]) leapfrog_stepv in exact e').

Print x'.  (* Demonstrates what x' looks like *)

(** When interpreting deep-embedded expressions, "Var"iables will appear
  which are labeled by identifiers such as "_x" and "_v".  We want a
  "varmap" for looking up the values of those variables.  We'll compute
  that varmap in two stages.  Step one, given values "x" and "v", 
  make an association list mapping _x to x, and _v to v,  each labeled
  by its floating-point type.  *)

Definition leapfrog_vmap_list (x v : ftype Tsingle) := 
   [(_x, existT ftype _ x);(_v, existT ftype _ v)].

(** Step two, build that into "varmap" data structure, taking care to
  compute it into a lookup-tree ___here___, not later in each place
  where we look something up. *)

(**  Demonstration of reification and reflection.   When you have a 
  deep-embedded "expr"ession, you can get back the shallow embedding
   by applying the "fval" function *)

(** The main point of VCFloat is to prove bounds on the roundoff error of
  floating-point expressions.  Generally those bounds are provable only if
  the free variables of the expression (e.g., "x" and "v") are themselves 
  bounded in some way;  otherwise, the expression might overflow.
  A "boundsmap" is a mapping from identifier (such as "_x") to
  a "varinfo", which gives its (floating-point) and its lower and upper bound. *)

(** First we make an association list.  This one says that 
   -2.0 <= x <= 2.0   and   -2.0 <= v <= 2.0  *)
Definition leapfrog_bmap_list : list varinfo := 
  [ Build_varinfo Tsingle _x (-2)  2 ;  Build_varinfo Tsingle _v (-2)  2 ].

(** Then we calculate an efficient lookup table, the "boundsmap". *)
Definition leapfrog_bmap : boundsmap :=
 ltac:(let z := compute_PTree (boundsmap_of_list leapfrog_bmap_list) in exact z).

(** Now we prove that the leapfrogx expression (deep-embedded as  x' )
   has a roundoff error less than 1.0e-5 *)

 (* This divides into two proof goals.  
  Goal 1 is "prove_rndval", which generates a list of verification conditions 
        about subexpressions of x'; and if those can be proved, then
  x' evaluates equivalent to a perturbed expression.
  Goal 2 shows that the perturbed expression evaluates "close to"
  the exact real-number interpretation of expression x'.  *)
